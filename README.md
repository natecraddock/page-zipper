# Page Zipper
Page Zipper is a tool to aid in the document capture process. It is designed to merge (zip) right and left captured pages of books.

Page Zipper takes input from two folders, for the left and right pages, merges the pages like a zipper (right, left, right, left, right, left), and saves the images in a specified output directory.

## The Problem
At the [Shelby County Museum & Archive](https://shelbycountymuseum.com) we had been capturing images of the old courthouse records for over a year without a problem. We then encountered books too large to take pictures of! And we couldn't move the books side to side without damaging them.

## The Solution
We decided that capturing the right and left pages separately would be the easiest way to proceed. Page Zipper was created to merge the left and right pages together.
